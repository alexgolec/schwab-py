================
Streaming Client
================

A wrapper around the Schwab streaming data API.  This API is a websockets-based 
streaming API that provides to up-to-the-second data on market activity. Most 
impressively, it provides realtime data, including Level Two and time of sale 
data for major equities, options, and futures exchanges. 

Here's an example of how you can receive book snapshots of ``GOOG`` (note if you 
run this outside regular trading hours you may not see anything):

.. code-block:: python

  from schwab.auth import easy_client
  from schwab.client import Client
  from schwab.streaming import StreamClient

  import asyncio
  import json

  # Assumes you've already created a token. See the authentication page for more
  # information.
  client = easy_client(
          api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
          app_secret='YOUR_APP_SECRET',
          callback_url='https://127.0.0.1',
          token_path='/path/to/token.json')
  stream_client = StreamClient(client, account_id=1234567890)

  async def read_stream():
      await stream_client.login()
 
      def print_message(message):
        print(json.dumps(message, indent=4))

      # Always add handlers before subscribing because many streams start sending 
      # data immediately after success, and messages with no handlers are dropped.
      stream_client.add_nasdaq_book_handler(print_message)
      await stream_client.nasdaq_book_subs(['GOOG'])

      while True:
          await stream_client.handle_message()

  asyncio.run(read_stream())

Use Overview
++++++++++++

The example above demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for using ``schwab.stream``. 
There's more in there than meets the eye, so let's dive into the details.


----------
Logging In
----------

Before we can perform any stream operations, the client must be logged in to the 
stream. Unlike the HTTP client, in which every request is authenticated using a 
token, this client sends unauthenticated requests and instead authenticates the 
entire stream. As a result, this login process is distinct from the token 
generation step that's used in the HTTP client.

Stream login is accomplished simply by calling :meth:`StreamClient.login()`. Once
this happens successfully, all stream operations can be performed. Attemping to
perform operations that require login before this function is called raises an
exception.

.. automethod:: schwab.streaming.StreamClient.login


-----------
Logging Out
-----------

For a clean exit, it's recommended to log out of the stream when you're done.

.. automethod:: schwab.streaming.StreamClient.logout


----------------------
Subscribing to Streams
----------------------

These functions have names that follow the pattern ``SERVICE_NAME_subs``. These 
functions send a request to enable streaming data for a particular data stream. 
They are *not* thread safe, so they should only be called in series.

When subscriptions are called multiple times on the same stream, the results 
vary. What's more, these results aren't documented in the official 
documentation. As a result, it's recommended not to call a subscription function 
more than once for any given stream.

Some services, notably :ref:`equity_charts` and :ref:`futures_charts`, 
offer ``SERVICE_NAME_add`` functions which can be used to add symbols to the 
stream after the subscription has been created. For others, calling the 
subscription methods again seems to clear the old subscription and create a new 
one. Note this behavior is not officially documented, so this interpretation may 
be incorrect.


----------------------
Add symbols to Streams
----------------------

These functions have names that follow the pattern ``SERVICE_NAME_add``.
These functions send a request to add to the list of subscribed symbols for a
particular data stream.


-------------------------
Un-Subscribing to Streams
-------------------------

These functions have names that follow the pattern ``SERVICE_NAME_unsubs``.
These functions send a request to disable the symbols of a streaming data for a
particular data stream. They are *not* thread safe, so they should only be
called in series. When unsubscribing to services with symbols, symbols which
were not explicitly unsubscribed remain subscribed.


--------------------
Registering Handlers
--------------------

By themselves, the subscription functions outlined above do nothing except cause 
messages to be sent to the client. The ``add_SERVICE_NAME_handler`` functions 
register functions that will receive these messages when they arrive. When 
messages arrive, these handlers will be called serially. There is no limit to 
the number of handlers that can be registered to a service.


.. _registering_handlers:

-----------------
Handling Messages
-----------------

Once the stream client is properly logged in, subscribed to streams, and has 
handlers registered, we can start handling messages. This is done simply by 
awaiting on the ``handle_message()`` function. This function reads a single 
message and dispatches it to the appropriate handler or handlers.

If a message is received for which no handler is registered, that message is 
ignored.

Handlers should take a single argument representing the stream message received:

.. code-block:: python

  import json

  def sample_handler(msg):
      print(json.dumps(msg, indent=4))


---------------------
Data Field Relabeling
---------------------

Under the hood, this API returns JSON objects with numerical key representing
labels: 

.. code-block:: python

  {
    "service": "CHART_EQUITY",
    "timestamp": 1715908546054,
    "command": "SUBS",
    "content": [{
          "seq": 0,
          "key": "MSFT",
          "1": 779,
          "2": 421.65,
          "3": 421.79,
          "4": 421.65,
          "5": 421.755,
          "6": 26.0,
          "7": 1715903940000,
          "8": 19859
      }]
  }

These labels are tricky to decode, and require a knowledge of the documentation 
to decode properly. ``schwab-api`` makes your life easier by doing this decoding 
for you, replacing numerical labels with strings proposed by the community For 
instance, the message above would be relabeled as:

.. code-block:: python

  {
    "service": "CHART_EQUITY",
    "timestamp": 1715908546054,
    "command": "SUBS",
    "content": [{
          "seq": 0,
          "key": "MSFT",
          "SEQUENCE": 779,
          "OPEN_PRICE": 421.65,
          "HIGH_PRICE": 421.79,
          "LOW_PRICE": 421.65,
          "CLOSE_PRICE": 421.755,
          "VOLUME": 26.0,
          "CHART_TIME_MILLIS": 1715903940000,
          "CHART_DAY": 19859
      }]
  }

This documentation describes the various fields and their numerical values. You 
can find them by investigating the various enum classes ending in ``***Fields``.

Some streams, such as the ones described in :ref:`level_one`, allow you to
specify a subset of fields to be returned. Subscription handlers for these
services take a list of the appropriate field enums the extra ``fields``
parameter. If nothing is passed to this parameter, all supported fields are 
requested.


---------------
Stream Statuses
---------------

Schwab's streaming functionality is very similar to that of the former 
TDAmeritrade. So similar, in fact, that this module is largely a direct 
adaptation of the implementation developed for the older `tda-api library
<https://tda-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/streaming.html>`__. 

As a result of this nearly direct copy-pasting, some streams may have been 
carried over which don't actually work. What's more, some streams *never* 
worked, even in ``tda-api``, but were only implemented because some old, 
now-defunct documentation referred to them.

The community is in the process of making sense of this new world. You are 
encouraged to try and use this streaming library and report what you find back 
to our `Discord server <https://discord.gg/BEr6y6Xqyv>`__. We'll be updating 
this page as we discover new things.

.. _level_two:

++++++++++++++++++++
Level Two Order Book 
++++++++++++++++++++

Level two streams provide a view on continuous order books of various securities.
The level two order book describes the current bids and asks on the market, and 
these streams provide snapshots of that state.

Due to the lack of official documentation, these streams are largely reverse 
engineered.  While the labeled data represents a best effort attempt to
interpret stream fields, it's possible that something is wrong or incorrectly
labeled.

The documentation lists more book types than are implemented here. In 
particular, it also lists ``FOREX_BOOK``, ``FUTURES_BOOK``, and
``FUTURES_OPTIONS_BOOK`` as accessible streams. All experimentation has resulted 
in these streams refusing to connect, typically returning errors about 
unavailable services. Due to this behavior and the lack of official 
documentation for book streams generally, ``schwab-api`` assumes these streams are not
actually implemented, and so excludes them. If you have any insight into using
them, please `let us know <https://github.com/alexgolec/schwab-api/issues>`__.


-------------------------------------
Equities Order Books: NYSE and NASDAQ
-------------------------------------

``schwab-api`` supports level two data for NYSE and NASDAQ, which are the two major 
exchanges dealing in equities, ETFs, etc. Stocks are typically listed on one or 
the other, and it is useful to learn about the differences between them:

 * `"The NYSE and NASDAQ: How They Work" on Investopedia
   <https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/103103.asp>`__
 * `"Here's the difference between the NASDAQ and NYSE" on Business Insider
   <https://www.businessinsider.com/
   heres-the-difference-between-the-nasdaq-and-nyse-2017-7>`__
 * `"Can Stocks Be Traded on More Than One Exchange?" on Investopedia
   <https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/stockmultipleexchanges.asp>`__

You can identify on which exchange a symbol is listed by using
:meth:`Client.search_instruments() <schwab.client.Client.search_instruments>`:

.. code-block:: python

  r = c.search_instruments(['GOOG'], projection=c.Instrument.Projection.FUNDAMENTAL)
  assert r.status_code == httpx.codes.OK, r.raise_for_status()
  print(r.json()['GOOG']['exchange'])  # Outputs NASDAQ

However, many symbols have order books available on these streams even though 
this API call returns neither NYSE nor NASDAQ. The only sure-fire way to find out
whether the order book is available is to attempt to subscribe and see what 
happens.

Note to preserve equivalence with what little documentation there is, the NYSE
book is called "listed." Testing indicates this stream corresponds to the NYSE
book, but if you find any behavior that suggests otherwise please
`let us know <https://github.com/alexgolec/schwab-api/issues>`__.

------------------
Options Order Book
------------------

This stream provides the order book for options. It's not entirely clear what 
exchange it aggregates from, but it's been tested to work and deliver data. The 
leading hypothesis is that it is the order book for the 
`Chicago Board of Exchange <https://www.cboe.com/us/options>`__ options 
exchanges, although this is an admittedly an uneducated guess.
